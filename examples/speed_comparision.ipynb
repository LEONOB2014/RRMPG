    "# Numba Speed-Test\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook I'll test the speed of a simple hydrological model (the ABC-Model [1]) implemented in pure Python, Numba and Fortran. This should only been seen as an example of the power of numba in speeding up array-oriented python functions, that have to be processed using loops. This is for example the case for hydrological models that have to be processed timestep after timestep to update model states (depending on previous states) and calculate flows. Python is natively very slow for this kind of functions (loops). Normally hydrological (as well as meterological and environmental) models are implemented in Fortran or C/C++ which are known for their speed. The downside is, that this languages are quite harder to start with and the code often seems overly complicated for beginner. Numba is a library that performs just-in-time compilation on Python code and can therefore dramatically increase the speed of Python functions (without having to change much in the code).\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway, this is not meant to give an introduction to numba, but just to compare the execution speed against pure Python and Fortan. For everybody, who is interested in further explanations on Numba see:\n",
